A Notes app I created using Android Studio that helps the user create/edit notes. 
- It is built for Android Studio Using Kotlin language
- Users can create, edit, search and delete notes
- User can rate notes with a star system to indicate importance and the most important notes are automatically sorted at the top
- Uses the Room Database in order to store and manage notes
- Follows the Model View View model architecture for clean and maintanable code
